### 🌱 **Learning Journey**

I believe in **structured, intentional growth**. To stay on track, I maintain a public **[Learning Roadmap](https://github.com/DLPietro/learning-roadmap)** that outlines my goals, milestones, and resources across data science, engineering, and analysis best practices.

### Quant Analysis:
🎓 ["Empirical Comparison: S&P 500, iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV), and Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX)"](https://github.com/DLPietro/thesis-backtesting-etf-spx)  
Used R to conduct a 10-year empirical analysis (2013–2023) comparing passive vs. active fund performance, including:
- Linear regression on log-returns
- GARCH modeling for volatility
- Backtesting of three portfolio strategies (Equally Weighted, Mean-Variance, Mean-CVaR)
- Performance metrics: Sharpe Ratio, Maximum Drawdown, Tracking Error
