# Hi there 👋 I'm Pietro Di Leo

**Operations Officer** | **Quant Finance Graduate** | MSc in *Finance and Quantitative Methods for Economics* (LM-16)  
I've been spending 3 years in a **Custody Company** in Malta - moving data, writing reports, and using repetitive procedures.

Now, I'm building my own way with **Python, R, and SQL in real-world data projects**.

📍 Malta | 🌍 Working on **Data Analysis, Programming and Statistical Research**

### 💥 Why I'm doing this:

Let’s be honest:  
- I'm paid to do **manual work** in a **data-rich industry**
- The tools? Excel without macros, PDF reports, copy-paste
- The growth and the impact? Minimal

I stopped waiting and I started building then!!

### 🛠 What I Build

I don’t follow tutorials. I solve problems.

#### 🎰 [iGaming Analytics Dashboard ⚠️⚠️⚠️(🔨 WORK IN PROGRESS)](https://github.com/DLPietro/igaming-analytics-case-study)
- Building a simulated iGaming analytics system from scratch: analyzed player session patterns, cohort retention, and campaign ROI using synthetic data
- Using SQL for cohort analysis, Python for trend detection, and Tableau for interactive dashboards
- Identifying key insights: players using WELCOME100 promo had 2.3x higher LTV; churn spiked after Day 7 without deposit
- Project publicly documented with full code, queries, and dashboard

#### 📉 [Empirical Comparison: S&P 500 vs. IVV vs. Fidelity Contrafund (R)](https://github.com/DLPietro/thesis-backtesting-etf-spx)
- 10-year analysis in R: GARCH, backtesting, Sharpe, CVaR
- Proved that active management often doesn’t beat the market
- Full code, results, and storytelling on GitHub

#### 📊 [Portfolio Risk Calculator (Python)](https://github.com/DLPietro/portfolio-risk-calculator)
- Pulls live market data
- Computes Sharpe Ratio, CVaR, Max Drawdown
- Turns portfolio analysis from hours to seconds

#### 🧮 [Custody NAV Calculator (Python)](https://github.com/DLPietro/custody-nav-calculator)
- Automates daily NAV reporting
- Uses Python + live market data
- Reduces manual work and errors

👉 All projects are on my GitHub — no fluff, just code and results.
